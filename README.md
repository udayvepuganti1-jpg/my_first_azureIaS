Azure Infrastructure as Code with Terraform
Welcome to my first Azure Infrastructure as Code (IaC) project using Terraform!
This repository contains code to automate the provisioning of core Azure resources, enabling a repeatable and robust cloud setup.

ðŸš€ Features
Automated Infrastructure: Instantly deploys Azure Resource Group, Virtual Network, and other components using Terraform.

Version-Controlled IaC: Keep track of all changes with Git and easily collaborate.

Modular & Reusable: Code is structured for scalability and can be expanded as your needs grow.
